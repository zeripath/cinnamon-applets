Zeripath's Cinnamon Applets
===========================

This is a collection of personal applets and tools I find helpful.

* Window-List-Applet: A modified version of the default window-list applet
that has functionality for maximizing and unmaximizing windows.
* Patch-Mint-X-Theme: An automated script to patch the Mint-X theme to hide the
titlebar on maximized windows. I use this with the above applet to save screen
estate.
* Power-Applet: A modified version of the default power applet that will put
information about all power sources in the systray. This is especially useful if
you have two batteries but the main battery isn't used first.
